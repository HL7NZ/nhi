Validate Patient processing steps:

1. The user initiates a validate request in the integrating application
2. The integrating application sends an HTTP POST request using a $Match operation to the NHI with onlyCertainMatches set to True
3. The request is validated - ALT: Validation failure. OperationOutcome resource returned
4. The NHI validates whether the Patient details and nhi-id provided are a certain match
5. If there is a certain match the NHI FHIR API returns a Bundle containing only the Patient record with the nhi-id showing. Alt: Empty Bundle returned with OperationOutcome resource returned.
6. The integrating application displays the results of the validate to the user.
