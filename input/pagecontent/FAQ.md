### Is building name part of the eSAM address details?
No, eSAM addresses do not include any details about apartment names or retirement village names.  Building name is entered by a user and provided to the NHI in addition to the eSAM address ID.


### How do I retrieve the patient’s general practice EDI address?

[Guidance here](/guidance.html#lookup-edi-for-an-enrolled-patients-general-practice)


### Why doesn’t the Patient version change when the enrolled general practice or telecom contacts change for a patient

The enrolled general practice and contact details are not held in the NHI but are retrieved from the National Enrolment Service and returned along with the NHI details in the NHI Patient profile. The Patient Version-id only reflects when details held on the NHI change.


### Are the ethnicities in NHI listed in a certain order, are they prioritised?

There is no ordering of ethnicities on the NHI – they are returned as supplied to the NHI. 
If a prioritised ethnicity is required on output for analysis/reporting/kpi etc then follow the rules described in the Ethnicity data Protocol section 5.5.2 Prioritised Output
