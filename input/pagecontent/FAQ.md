### How do I retrieve the patient’s general practice EDI address?

[Guidance here](/guidance.html#lookup-edi-for-an-enrolled-patients-general-practice)

### Why doesn’t the Patient version change when the enrolled general practice or telecom contacts change for a patient

The enrolled general practice and contact details are not held in the NHI but are retrieved from the National Enrolment Service and returned along with the NHI details in the NHI Patient profile. The Patient Version-id only reflects when details held on the NHI change.
