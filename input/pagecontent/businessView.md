### Purpose of NHI and history
The National Health Index (NHI) enables users to identify a patient using a unique NHI identifier (NHI Number) linked to their identity information. The use of a common NHI number reduces the risks to patient clinical safety, privacy, and supports information sharing.
 
To effectively use and maintain the NHI information, each time a patient presents, healthcare providers should locate and confirm the patient identity, synchronise the data held locally with the NHI, and identify and resolve any identity data conflicts. These business functions consist of:

#### Locate and Confirm Identity
* Locate – Search a patient identity.
* View – View the local and NHI patient record.
* Confirm – Match a patient identity to the patient.

#### Establish Identity
* Add – Add a new patient identity to the NHI.
* Reserve – Reserve NHI identifier (planned in future releases).

#### Maintain and Synchronise Identity
* Review – Compare local and NHI patient identity information.
* Update – Maintain NHI patient identity information.
* Refresh – Update local record with NHI patient identity information.
* Resolve – Record patient identity information conflicts (e.g. overlay) and outcomes.

As a result of integrating identity web services, application users can access and update the patient identity information in the NHI. This supports high quality, up to date identity information both locally and nationally. In addition, it is expected the application will support standard business processes, making it easy for the user to correctly complete identity related business functions.
 
In addition, there are technical compliance considerations for integration of identity web services:

#### Manage Patient Identity Requests
* Error handling – handling errors, warnings, and informational messages
* Request Identification – identification of the person, organisation, application, and timing for every request
* Authentication – ensuring a user, application, and organisation is authenticated
